This is the main Dagster workspace for the entire data pipeline. It loads all relevant Dagster code locations from various repositories as Python module dependencies. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Run `poetry install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Execute `bin/start` to launch the Dagster instance.

By default, the Dagster home location is set to `~/.natureframework/dagster/instance`.
